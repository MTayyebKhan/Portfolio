## T1A2 Assignment

**Purpose**
The reason behind this portfolio is to demonsrate my *ability* to create a website portfolio about myself, demonstrating what I have learned so far and capable of creating. As the year goes on, I will further update my portfolio in line with what I can further do. Furthermore, I created something I enjoy looking at, with my limited skillset, and would enjoy seeing how much futher I will be able to develop this page into.

**Functionality/Features**
Basically created 4 linked pages that includes a home, blog, experience and a *simple* contact page for any user to understand. A nav bar that follows you down each page for easy access with a "go to top" button aswell. It has always been created to work on mobiles, tablets and desktops, with a similar color theme throughout the pages on all devices.
