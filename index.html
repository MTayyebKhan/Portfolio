                        <p>Speaking of food, I love food. Like, if you need to eat you should, and don't let anything stop you, more recently though I've been eating abit too much.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I think we can all agree that we have worked once in our lives, but honestly my favourite training to date has to be MMA and the discipline that comes with it.</p>
